  * provide more functions for bigintegers, such as sum, prod, min, max, sort,
    order ...

  * Better integration to R with as.integer.big(q/z), as.data.frame ...

  * more matrix and linear algebra computation functions (SVD, eigen values, 
    determinant).

  * provide basic algorithmns and number theoretic symbols (CRA, Jacobi symbol)

  * provide binary-to-biginteger interface with bitwise operations (i.e., bit access to big integers)

  * test, test, test, ...
