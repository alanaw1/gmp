* Bug Fixes								-*-org-*-

***  chooseZ() is *not* vectorized; neither factorialZ(), fibnum(), etc

***  as.bigz(1:4) + as.bigq(7)  fails

***  <bigq> ^ 2  fails


* Matrix things

***  3*M and M*3  are not the same: the first forgets the "nrow" ...

***  x <- as.bigz(2:5); x[1] <- -1; x # --- is a matrix !!!!

***  also want different  M[1,] and M[1] for big[zq] matrices

***  as.matrix(as.bigq(1:4)),  as.matrix(as.bigz(1:4)) both fail:
   MM: I'd want   as.matrix(<big* matrix>) to convert *back* to
   double/integer matrix, as we have no other convenient way for that yet.

***  abs(.) or sign(<big..matrix>) {and probably many others!}
     return vector instead of matrix, i.e.., lose the "nrow" attribute.

***  cbind(<bigz>, <bigq>)  returns raw ...

* More general, previous 'TODO':

***  The print() method is improved; but matrices are not "noted" yet.
   Still needs discussion; should be shorter for length 1 ?
   We could have an option() .. to suppress the initial line. Fine for
   bigq, but not for bigz

***  provide more functions for bigintegers, such as
   sort, order ...

*** more matrix and linear algebra computation functions (SVD, eigen values,
    determinant).

*** provide basic algorithms and number theoretic symbols (CRA, Jacobi symbol)

*** provide binary-to-biginteger interface with bitwise operations (i.e., bit access to big integers)

* Systematic Testing

*** Arithmetic, Comparison, etc: ensure pairwise compatibility <bigz>, <bigq>, <numeric>

*** tests/gmp-test.R: contains Antoine's previous test suite,
